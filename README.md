# Pneumonia Detection in Chest X-Ray's using Transfer Learning

The project aims to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) model using transfer learning to classify pneumonia based on chest X-ray images. The input dataset will be preprocessed using filters to improve accuracy, and the output will be evaluated using a confusion matrix.
